The goal of abstraction is to provide a simplified view of the object that focuses on what it does, rather than how it does it. For example, consider a class named \"Vehicle\" that represents a generic vehicle.

The goal of encapsulation is to create a secure and isolated environment for the object, where its data is protected from external access and modification, and its behavior can be controlled through a well-defined interface. For example, the properties of the \"Vehicle\" class in the previous example could be marked as private, to prevent external access and modification. This ensures that the data of the object is secure and can only be manipulated through the methods provided by the class.\n",
